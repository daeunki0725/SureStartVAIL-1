- I hoped to get a lot of more project based experience when it comes to AI. I always watch videos about new research and some theory about deep neural networks, but I always wanted to have more projects so that I can be accustomed to technologies that are being used for neural networks used for everyday life. With that experience, I want to get into deep learning research in the future and strengthen my foundations in the field.

- The difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is supervised learning is labeled data and can be used to train models with a cost function that is used for predictions. Unsupervised learning is more for finding clusters and patterns in given unlabled data. Scikit-learn doesn't have the power to visualize data without other data analysis libraries since the library is more for developing and training models for data. Other data analysis libraries can interpret the data for visualization, hence why scikit-learn is usually used with Graphiviz, Pandas, and matplotlib.

- Tensors are multidimensional arrays and is usually represented by an array of 3R numbers in a 3-dimensional space. With its structure, it is able to do fast calculations simulataneously and update its values extremely fast. When doing the tensorflow calculations, it was faster than I thought since there were a lot of numbers that need to be computed, yet the runtime was still relatively fast.

- One real-world problem is credit card fraud detection. There are a lot of variables that are being kept track of when making purchases with a credit card and companies can use a deep neural network to detect possible fraudulent transactions through a classification problem. A dataset that I found can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). One possible deep learning algorithm for it would be a feed-forward neural network as we can do a classification problem given a large enough dataset. The feed-forward neural network is also simple and has less chance of overfitting the dataset that was given for this particular problem.

- Machine Learning was utilized to automate the hiring process for a startup in Orange Valley. As there was bias and skewness in the dataset that was used to train the machine learning algorithm, the outputs for the model were also biased and was very problematic as it rejected a lot of blue candidates even if they were qualified enough for the position. A real world example of a biased machine learning model is the use for face verification for devices. Some people who look similar due to race can sometimes unlock the device. One way around this issue is to train the model on data that it gets incorrect to compensate for the examples that are being misclassified. Getting a larger dataset of the subgroup can also help reduce bias in the outputs of the models.
