- I hoped to get a lot of more project based experience when it comes to AI. I always watch videos about new research and some theory about deep neural networks, but I always wanted to have more projects so that I can be accustomed to technologies that are being used for neural networks used for everyday life. With that experience, I want to get into deep learning research in the future and strengthen my foundations in the field.

- The difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is supervised learning is labeled data and can be used to train models with a cost function that is used for predictions. Unsupervised learning is more for finding clusters and patterns in given unlabled data. Scikit-learn doesn't have the power to visualize data without other data analysis libraries since the library is more for developing and training models for data. Other data analysis libraries can interpret the data for visualization, hence why scikit-learn is usually used with Graphiviz, Pandas, and matplotlib.
