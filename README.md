- I hoped to get a lot of more project based experience when it comes to AI. I always watch videos about new research and some theory about deep neural networks, but I always wanted to have more projects so that I can be accustomed to technologies that are being used for neural networks used for everyday life. With that experience, I want to get into deep learning research in the future and strengthen my foundations in the field.
